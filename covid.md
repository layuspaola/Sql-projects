as it is a large dataset with multiples rows i decided to divide it by deaths and vaccination
I used Google Bigquery
As i am from Argentina the focus will be on my country, continent

# Covid 19 Data Exploration

### Table ordered by continent and location

``` sql
SELECT * FROM `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_deaths` 
order by continent, location
```

### Table ordered by continent and location

```sql
SELECT * FROM `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_vacs` 
order by continent, location
```


### show covid death table ordered by location and date

```sql
SELECT * FROM `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_deaths` 
where continent is not null
order by location, date
```

### After Exploration 
I decide to start with selecting the data to work with

```sql
SELECT Location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population
FROM `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_deaths` 
where continent is not null
order by location, date
```

## Total death count 

### By continent

```sql
Select continent, MAX(cast(Total_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
From `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_deaths`
Where continent is not null 
Group by continent
order by TotalDeathCount desc;
```

### By Country

```sql
Select location, MAX(cast(Total_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
From `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_deaths`
Where continent is not null 
Group by location
order by TotalDeathCount desc;
```

## Total Cases vs Total Deaths
#### Shows likelihood of dying if you contract covid in your country where the cases are more that 0

```sql
SELECT Location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_deaths`
WHERE total_cases IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY location,  date;
```
#### Shows likelihood of dying if you contract covid in your country where the cases are more that 0 in Argentina

```sql
Select Location, date, total_cases,total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
FROM `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_deaths`
Where location like '%Arg%'
and total_cases is not null 
order by location, date
```

### Countries with the highest infection compared with their population

```sql
Select Location, Population, MAX(total_cases) as infection_highest, Max((total_cases/population))*100 as pop_infected
FROM `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_deaths`
Group by Location, Population
order by pop_infected desc
```

# In Argentina

```sql
Select Location, Population, MAX(total_cases) as infection_highest, Max((total_cases/population))*100 as pop_infected
FROM `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_deaths`
WHERE location LIKE '%Arg%
order by pop_infected desc
```
### Countries that had the more deaths compared with their population

```sql
Select Location, MAX(cast(Total_deaths as int)) as Total_Death
FROM `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_deaths`
Where continent is not null 
Group by Location
order by Total_Death desc
```

### Ordered Death_count by continent

```sql
Select continent, MAX(cast(Total_deaths as int)) as Total_Death
FROM `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_deaths`
Where continent is not null 
Group by continent
order by Total_Death desc
```
### Total death VS infection count and its percentage
```sql
SELECT
  SUM(new_cases) AS total_cases,  SUM(CAST(new_deaths AS int)) AS total_deaths,  SUM(CAST(new_deaths AS int))/SUM(New_Cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM  `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_deaths`
WHERE  continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY total_cases, total_deaths;
```


### Now i start the vaccines exploration by joining the tables

```sql
SELECT  *
FROM  `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_deaths` dea
JOIN  `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_vacs` vac
ON  dea.location = vac.location  AND dea.date = vac.date;
```

### Once joined the tables i proceed to select the data of when the countries started to vaccinate, the total vaccines orderd by continent, location and date

```sql
Select dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations 
FROM `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_deaths`  dea
join `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_vacs` vac
on dea.location = vac.location 
and dea.date = vac.date
where dea.continent is not null
and vac.new_vaccinations is not null
order by 1,2,3
```

### When countries started vaccination and the sum by date
```sql
SELECT  dea.continent,  dea.location,  dea.date,  dea.population,  vac.new_vaccinations,
SUM(CAST( vac.new_vaccinations AS int)) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) AS sum_new_vacs
FROM  `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_deaths` dea
JOIN  `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_vacs` vac
ON  dea.location = vac.location  AND dea.date = vac.date
WHERE  dea.continent IS NOT NULL  AND vac.new_vaccinations IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY  2,  3;
```
### When Argentina started vaccination and the sum by date

```sql
SELECT
  dea.continent,  dea.location,  dea.date, dea.population,  vac.new_vaccinations,
  SUM(CAST( vac.new_vaccinations AS int)) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) AS sum_new_vacs
FROM  `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_deaths` dea
JOIN  `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_vacs` vac
ON  dea.location = vac.location  AND dea.date = vac.date
WHERE  dea.location like '%Arg%'
  AND vac.new_vaccinations IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY  2,  3;
```
## create a CTE
```sql
WITH  popvaccinated AS
 (
  SELECT
    dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date,  dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations,
    SUM(CAST(vac.new_vaccinations AS INT)) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) AS sum_new_vacs
  FROM   `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_deaths` AS dea
  JOIN   `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_vacs` AS vac
  ON   dea.location = vac.location
       AND dea.date = vac.date
  WHERE  dea.location LIKE '%Arg%'   AND vac.new_vaccinations IS NOT NULL
 )
SELECT  *
FROM  popvaccinated;
```
### To create a percentage of the sum of new vaccination a CTE is needed

```sql
WITH  popvaccinated AS
 (
  SELECT
    dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date,  dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations,
    SUM(CAST(vac.new_vaccinations AS INT)) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) AS sum_new_vacs
  FROM   `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_deaths` AS dea
  JOIN  `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_vacs` AS vac
  ON dea.location = vac.location
    AND dea.date = vac.date
  WHERE  dea.continent is not null   AND vac.new_vaccinations IS NOT NULL
 )
SELECT  *,  (sum_new_vacs / population) * 100 AS percentage_vaccinated
FROM  popvaccinated;
```
### CTE focused on South America

```sql
WITH
  popvaccinated AS
(
  SELECT
    dea.continent,  dea.location,  dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations,
SUM(CAST(vac.new_vaccinations AS INT)) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) AS sum_new_vacs
  FROM  `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_deaths` AS dea
  JOIN  `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_vacs` AS vac
  ON
    dea.location = vac.location
    AND dea.date = vac.date
  WHERE dea.continent = "South America"
    AND vac.new_vaccinations IS NOT NULL
 )
SELECT *, (sum_new_vacs / population) * 100 AS percentage_vaccinated
FROM popvaccinated;
```
### CTE focused on Argentina

```sql
WITH
  popvaccinated AS (
  SELECT
    dea.continent,  dea.location,  dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations,
SUM(CAST(vac.new_vaccinations AS INT)) OVER (PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) AS sum_new_vacs
  FROM  `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_deaths` AS dea
  JOIN  `mi-1er-proyecto-382317.covid.covid_vacs` AS vac
  ON
    dea.location = vac.location
    AND dea.date = vac.date
  WHERE dea.location LIKE '%Arg%'
    AND vac.new_vaccinations IS NOT NULL
 )
SELECT *, (sum_new_vacs / population) * 100 AS percentage_vaccinated
FROM popvaccinated;
```
